# New-York-Solar-Initiative
The New York Solar Initiative has been collecting information on solar energy projects across New York Since 2001. 
This project uses Microsoft SQL Server and SSIS to produce an ETL and Data Warehousing solution that harvests, cleans, and organizes the raw data collected from that 
initiative so that it is suitable for analysis. The analysis made possible by the solution will provide insight into what adjustments could be implemented to improve the outcome of solar projects. The solution consists of a Staging, Operational Data Store, and Data Warehousing Layer. The Staging Layer extracts data from a JSON source using a Script Component. The Dictionary Tables in the ODS Layer are loaded and updated using Lookup Transformations. The Data Warehouse Layer is designed with 3 fact tables, 8 Dimension Tables, and a Star Schema that includes a Date Dimension. All the tables in the Data Warehouse are loaded using Merge Statements implemented using Stored Procedures and Execute SQL Tasks.
